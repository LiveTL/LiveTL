## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does LiveTL work?
LiveTL is, at its core, a chat filter for YouTube streams. It helps foreign viewers better catch translations that other viewers are providing in the live chat. LiveTL does not automatically translate streams -- instead, it picks up translations found in the chat.

### I installed LiveTL but I don't see any buttons. 
Once you install the extension, you must reload the YouTube stream for LiveTL to take effect.

### I don't see any translations in the translations panel.
If there are no translators in chat, LiveTL is unable to provide translations. Any messages properly tagged with a language (ex. `[en]`, `ESP:`, etc.) will appear when they are available.

### A translator is using their own style of language tags.
You can manually select additional users to filter in the settings.

### The YouTube video isn’t loading in Firefox.
You must manually allow video and audio autoplay in Firefox’s website preferences.
