## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does LiveTL work?
LiveTL is, at its core, a chat filter for YouTube streams. It helps foreign viewers better catch translations that other viewers are providing in the live chat. LiveTL does not automatically translate streams -- instead, it picks up translations found in the chat.

### I shared my stream with LiveTL but it isn't loading.
The stream chat may be temporarily unavailable. LiveTL will only load if the stream has a valid live chat or chat replay. 

### I don't see any translations in the translations panel.
If there are no translators in chat, LiveTL is unable to provide translations. Any messages properly tagged with a language (ex. `[en]`, `ESP:`, etc.) will appear when they are available.

### A translator is using their own style of language tags.
You can manually select additional users to filter in the settings.
