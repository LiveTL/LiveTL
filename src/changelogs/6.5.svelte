    <span slot="header">Translator mode is here!</span>
    <div>
      Translators can now make use of our all-new auto-prefixing and macro
      system. No longer do you have to type [en] before every message! You can
      enable translator mode in the settings menu under the "Chat" tab.

    <span slot="header">MChad Improvements</span>
    <div>
      There is now a duplicate message checker to prevent messages from MChad
      users showing up twice. Additionally, we have addressed several issues
      with MChad stopping mid-stream.

      Many of you may know that the Android app has been stuck on LiveTL v5 for many
      months. We are currently hard at work on upgrading the app to the newest version
      (v6). It's almost ready, so be sure to join our
