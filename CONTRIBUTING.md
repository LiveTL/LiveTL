# Contributing

LiveTL is open to contributors but note that we will not be assigning particular tasks to non-maintainers. Due to this,
we may also reject pull requests that cause major conflicts with a maintainer's local repository. Please first discuss
the change you wish to make via Github issue or with someone with the Developer role on
our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uJrV3tmthg) before making a change. With that being said, do not be afraid to make a
pull request as it will likely be accepted provided you have contacted a maintainer beforehand. If you have any ideas
not related to code that could still help LiveTL, do not hesitate to reach out to us on
our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uJrV3tmthg)!

LiveTL's contributors are bound to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, found in this repository as "
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"

If you are looking to help with UI/UX, please note that we do not have a style guide as of yet which means you will have
to essentially "wing it" should you wish to contribute.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Only pull requests to the development branch will be honored.
2. Explain what you did and how.
3. If its a new feature, explain what it is.
4. Add a screen shot if applicable.
5. Make sure it works on both Firefox and a Chromium-based browser

## Starting up a local development environment

help on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/uJrV3tmthg).**

- `make` will build the firefox and chrome extensions
    - The unpacked extension for each browser will be in `build/` and the packed extensions will be in `dist/`
- `make test` will run the available tests
    - The environment variables `DISABLE_CHROME` and `LEVEL` can be set to control the testing behavior.
    - The argument of `py` can be given to `make test` can change which python version is used.
- `make clean` will clear the build
- In firefox, use about:debuggging to load the extension.
- In chromium-based browsers, load an unpacked extension in the extension menu.

## Naming Scheme Conventions

- javascript is camelCased
- folders are hyphen-cased
