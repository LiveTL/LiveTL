**Checklist (make sure you do all these before you submit a bug report)**
- [ ] This is an issue for LiveTL, not Hyperchat. I will go to [the Hyperchat repo](https://github.com/LiveTL/HyperChat) to report an issue for Hyperchat.
- [ ] This is an issue for the LiveTL web extension, not LiveTL iOS or LiveTL Android. I will go to the [iOS](https://github.com/LiveTL/ios) or [Android](https://github.com/LiveTL/android) repo to report issues for those platforms.
- [ ] I have checked for a duplicate or similar issue. I made sure to check closed issues as well. 
- [ ] I am not reporting a bug. If I am, I will use the bug report issue template.
- [ ] I understand that I am not maintaining this codebase, and my suggestion may be rejected for any reason, including "We don't really feel like it" or "That's a little out of scope for this project" (We accept most suggestions, though.)
- [ ] I also understand that even if we do accept your suggestion, it may be removed from the extension at any time, for any reason, without notification. It might not make it to a release version of the extension.
